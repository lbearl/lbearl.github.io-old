title: Interview Tips from a Developer
---

## What the Problem Is
The company I currently work for is attempting to hire a bunch of developers. We really need more developers, but time and time again I see people walk in and claim that they are at the very upper end of senior in experience. While I certainly can't fault anyone for being confident (and of course trying to negotiate for more pay as would befit a senior developer), but if you say you're that senior then you had best be able to back up those claims.

## Backstory
Our interview process is pretty basic right now: developer comes in the door, takes a test, chats with the CTO of the company for a little bit and then 2-4 developers will come in and chat. The only really formal part of the process is the test. On the first page of the test, before any questions we ask developers to rate themselves in terms of seniority from Junior to Senior. For me personally, this is one of the most important questions on the test as it sets the tone for the rest of the interview.

I personally don't care to work with people who think they are more qualified than they are as they tend to underestimate the complexity of work, and in many cases don't even know what they don't know. 

## My Suggestions
I will preface this by saying that these are my opinions and I would not be surprised at all if they don't work at other companies. I think that they will work at most companies with a very tightly-knit team which values technical proficiency.

1. *Be Humble* - Specific to the test my company uses, be very realistic about what your experience level is. In general, realize that the people sitting on the other side of the table are simply trying to figure out if they want to spend 8+ hours a day with you for the forseeable future.
2. *Know what you're talking about* - Specific to the test, I see people who otherwise did really well try and B.S. answers to questions that they don't know. In general if you don't know something it is better to just admit you don't know it. When I took the test I only answered about half the questions because I was primarily a Java developer beforehand, but I articulated why I wasn't able to answer them.
3. *Remember this is a technical interview* - I have seen more than once when one of my colleagues will ask a question relating to overcoming a technical challenge, and the candidate responds with something that is business or interpersonal. While business and interpersonal issues are important to consider, as developers evaluating whether or not you have the experience you say you have, we need to know the juicy details of your _techical_ problems.
4. *Go into detail* - This relates to 3, but when we are asking questions please feel free to elaborate. Especially when it comes to your past experience, we have no idea of knowing it unless you tell us.
5. *Act like yourself* - My colleagues and I are all friendly towards one another. We try to only find people who we think will continue that trend. It is pretty easy for most of us to pick up on when someone is being artifically nice. The company is growing so we have less need for "Lone Cowboy" developers and a huge need for people who can work collaboratively in a team.

## Thanks!
While this probably isn't the most comprehensive piece ever written about interviewing, I hope it helps some developers land a new job. As always if you strongly disagree with me, feel free to reach out, my contact information is in the sidebar.
